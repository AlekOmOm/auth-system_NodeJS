# Auth Integration Tests TODO

## Observations from Test Results
1. ✅ Environment variable VITE_BACKEND_URL is undefined in tests - Fixed with vi.stubEnv
2. ✅ The structure of mock users in tests doesn't match actual API response - Fixed with updated mock data
3. ✅ Both fetch implementations now work in tests - Fixed with proper mocking
4. ✅ Missing proper error handling for authentication errors in login/register functions - Fixed with try/catch
5. ✅ Test for 'should handle API errors' had issues - Fixed with better assertions

## Improvements Made
1. ✅ Added proper environment variable handling in tests with vi.stubEnv
2. ✅ Unified user object structure between tests and API
3. ✅ Added better error handling for non-JSON responses in fetch.js
4. ✅ Implemented proper error handling in auth functions (now returns success: false for errors)
5. ✅ Added validation for user input in auth functions
6. ✅ Added more comprehensive tests for auth functions (including validation tests)
7. ✅ Added JSDoc documentation to functions

## Remaining Work
1. Add proper integration test for .env files and configuration
2. Add response type checks or interfaces for API responses
3. Consider adding handling for timeout errors
4. Add end-to-end tests for the full authentication flow
5. Implement proper loading and error state handling in UI components
6. Add more comprehensive input validation (e.g., password strength, email format)

## Browser Issue Fix
The issue in the browser was due to:
1. VITE_BACKEND_URL environment variable not being set correctly
2. The fetch utility not handling non-JSON responses properly
3. Lack of proper error handling in auth functions

Fixed by:
1. Added default backend URL in authApi.js
2. Improved error handling in fetch utilities
3. Added proper try/catch blocks in auth functions

## Final Test Report
✅ All 15 tests now pass successfully:
- 7 Tests for fetch utilities (fetchGet, fetchPost)
- 8 Tests for auth API (testApi, register, login)

## Next Steps for Production
1. Create a .env file at the frontend root with: VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3001/api
2. Consider using a .env.example file to document required environment variables
3. Implement the remaining work items from above list
4. Consider adding additional tests for edge cases
