# Authentication System Unit Tests

This directory contains unit tests for the authentication system.

## Test Files Overview

- **auth-service.test.js**: Tests for the authentication API service and fetch utilities.
- **auth-components.test.js**: Mocked component tests for the login and registration components.
- **integration.test.js**: Integration tests for the authentication flow.

## Test Results

- **auth-service.test.js**: ✅ All tests passing (14 tests)
- **auth-components.test.js**: ⚠️ Tests not running due to issues with svelte-routing
- **integration.test.js**: ⚠️ Tests not running due to issues with App.svelte parsing

## Code Improvement Suggestions

Based on our testing, here are some suggested improvements to the codebase:

### 1. Authentication API Service

- **TODO**: Add proper error handling for network failures in both register and login functions.
- **TODO**: Implement consistent response format across all API functions.
- **TODO**: Add input validation for more fields (email format, password complexity).

### 2. Fetch Utilities

- **TODO**: Consider adding retry logic for network failures.
- **TODO**: Add timeout handling to avoid indefinite waiting.
- **TODO**: Implement caching for repeated requests.

### 3. Components

- **TODO**: Improve form validation with immediate feedback to users.
- **TODO**: Add loading state indicators during API calls.
- **TODO**: Implement better error messaging for form validation.

### 4. Integration

- **TODO**: Add redirect handling after successful login/registration.
- **TODO**: Implement secure token storage and management.
- **TODO**: Add session timeout handling.

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test files
npx vitest run _unit-tests_/auth-service.test.js
```

## Test Coverage

To generate test coverage reports:

```bash
npm run test:coverage
```

## Known Issues

1. Component tests have issues with svelte-routing module resolution.
2. Integration tests fail due to Svelte syntax parsing issues in the test environment.
3. Some mocks may not fully represent the actual component behavior.

## Next Steps

1. Fix the svelte-routing import issues in component tests.
2. Add more comprehensive form validation tests.
3. Improve error handling throughout the application.
4. Implement end-to-end tests with a tool like Cypress.
