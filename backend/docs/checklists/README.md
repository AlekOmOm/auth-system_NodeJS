# Implementation Checklists

This directory contains checklists for tracking implementation status and ensuring best practices are followed.

## Available Checklists

| Checklist | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| [Authentication Checklist](./authentication.checklist.md) | Implementation status of authentication features |
| [Security Checklist](./security_checklist.md) | Security assessment and implementation status |

## How to Use Checklists

These checklists serve multiple purposes:

1. **Implementation Tracking**: Track what features have been implemented and what remains to be done
2. **Quality Assurance**: Ensure all necessary components and best practices are considered
3. **Documentation**: Document the current state of the system
4. **Planning**: Prioritize future development efforts

### Checklist Format

Each checklist uses Markdown task lists with the following format:

```markdown
- [x] Completed item
- [ ] Incomplete item
  - [ ] Sub-item
```

### Updating Checklists

When implementing features or enhancing the system:

1. Review the relevant checklist before starting work
2. Mark items as completed (`[x]`) as you implement them
3. Add notes about implementation decisions where appropriate
4. Add new checklist items if you identify additional requirements

### Creating New Checklists

To create a new checklist:

1. Create a new Markdown file with a descriptive name (e.g., `feature_name.checklist.md`)
2. Begin with a clear title and description
3. Organize items into logical sections
4. Include a prioritization section if appropriate
5. Reference relevant documentation or standards

## Checklist Best Practices

1. **Be Comprehensive**: Include all necessary steps and considerations
2. **Be Specific**: Provide enough detail to understand what's required
3. **Be Actionable**: Write items that can be clearly marked as done/not done
4. **Include References**: Link to relevant documentation or resources
5. **Prioritize**: Indicate which items are most important
