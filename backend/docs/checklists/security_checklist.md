# Authentication System Security Checklist

This checklist ensures your authentication system follows security best practices.

## Password Management

- [x] Passwords are hashed using a strong algorithm (bcryptjs)
- [x] Passwords are never stored in plaintext
- [x] Passwords are never exposed in API responses
- [x] Passwords have salt added before hashing
- [ ] Password strength requirements enforced
  - [ ] Minimum length (8+ characters recommended)
  - [ ] Complexity requirements (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols)
- [ ] Password breach detection (check against known compromised passwords)

## Session Management

- [x] Sessions stored server-side
- [x] Only session ID transmitted to client via cookies
- [x] Session cookies have appropriate security flags
  - [x] HttpOnly flag to prevent JavaScript access
  - [ ] Secure flag for HTTPS-only transmission (for production)
  - [ ] SameSite attribute to prevent CSRF
- [x] Sessions have reasonable expiration (24 hours)
- [x] Sessions can be invalidated (logout)
- [ ] Session rotation on privilege changes

## API Security

- [x] Rate limiting implemented to prevent brute force attacks
- [x] CORS configured to restrict access to trusted origins
- [ ] CSRF protection for authenticated requests
- [ ] Input validation on all parameters
- [ ] Output encoding to prevent XSS

## Authentication Flow

- [x] Clear separation between authentication and resource data
- [x] Login failures don't reveal specific error reasons
- [ ] Account lockout after repeated failures
- [ ] Two-factor authentication option
- [ ] Secure password reset flow

## Data Protection

- [x] Sensitive data never logged
- [ ] PII (Personally Identifiable Information) properly protected
- [ ] Data-in-transit encryption (HTTPS)
- [ ] Data-at-rest encryption for sensitive information

## Environment Security

- [x] Environment variables for sensitive configuration
- [x] Secrets management (SESSION_SECRET)
- [ ] Production vs. development environment differentiation

## Logging & Monitoring

- [ ] Authentication events logged
- [ ] Suspicious activity monitoring
- [ ] Failed login attempts tracked
- [ ] Automated alerts for unusual patterns

## Implementation Details

- [x] Secure dependency management (npm packages)
- [ ] Regular security updates to dependencies
- [ ] Code security reviews
- [ ] Security testing (penetration testing)

## Compliance Considerations

- [ ] GDPR compliance (if applicable)
- [ ] CCPA compliance (if applicable)
- [ ] Industry-specific requirements

## Deployment

- [ ] Security headers configured (HSTS, X-Content-Type-Options, etc.)
- [ ] Production hardening measures
- [ ] Database security (access control, encryption)
- [ ] Infrastructure security (firewalls, VPCs, etc.)

## Implementation Plan

For items not yet checked, prioritize implementation in this order:

1. **High Priority**
   - Password strength requirements
   - CSRF protection
   - Secure flag for cookies in production
   - Input validation

2. **Medium Priority**
   - Two-factor authentication
   - Account lockout after failures
   - Security headers
   - Logging authentication events

3. **Lower Priority**
   - Password breach detection
   - Automated alerts
   - Compliance considerations
